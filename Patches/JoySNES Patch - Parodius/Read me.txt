These patches allows to play to "Parodius Tako Saves Earth" on MSX with a
controller with 8 buttons for SNES using JoySNES adapter.

"Parodius (J) [JoySNES].IPS" file is the patch for original ROM (CRC32 =
9bb308f5).

"Parodius (translated to English) [JoySNES].IPS" file is the patch for
Roms translated to English.

Note: I have grouped these patches in the "Extra" folder for those who
      don't have them yet.

Use one of the following software to apply a patch.
http://www.msx.org/wiki/How_to_use_IPS_files

When the patch is applied to the Rom, the game will be
playable with only a SNES controller and a JoySNES or a controller for FM-Towns.


Buttons mapping in game:

 Directional pad = Player movements
 A = Fire
 B = Select a weapon
 Start = Pause / Continue the game after a game over
 X = Autofire (JoySNES only)
 Y = Same as B with Autofire, Usable but prefer B (JoySNES only)


How to execute the Rom:

- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC, use the loader FL.COM (by GDX) or
  OPFX.COM (by Manuel Pazos and Ramones).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC + SD, use OPFXSD.COM (by Manuel
  Pazos and Ramones).
- If you have a MegaSram SCC, use MGLOAD.COM (by Tsujikawa) or
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- If your MSX has a Memory Mapper of 512KB and a SCC cartridge (without
  game ROM) or more try with SROM.COM (by Louthrax).

These solutions are not exhaustive.
