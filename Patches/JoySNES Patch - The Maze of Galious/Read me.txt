This patch (v1.1) allows to play to "The Maze of Galious" on MSX with
the 8 buttons of a SNES controller using JoySNES adapter.


"MOG [JoySNES].IPS" file is the patch for original version.

The file "MOG-PT [JoySNES].IPS" is the patch for the translated
version in Portuguese by Lothian. This patch can be applied to
the original version or the already translated version.

Use one of the following software to apply the patch.
http://www.msx.org/wiki/How_to_use_IPS_files

When the patch is applied to the Rom, the game will be
 playable with only the JoySNES (in extended mode).

Buttons mapping:

Directional pad = Player Movements / Move cursor
  A = Sword Attack / Select
  B = Attack with the second weapon / Use the magnifying glass
  X = Jump or climb the ladder
  Y = Use the Halo
  R = Use the bible
  Start = Pause / Resume game
  Select = Show / Close options menu

The name of spells are written with the keyboard.


How to execute the Rom:

- If you have a MegaFlashRom with konami mapper without SCC, use the
  loader FLK4.COM (by GDX).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC, use the loader FL.COM (by GDX) or
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- If your MSX has a Memory Mapper of 512KB or more try with
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax). Be careful, the game does not work with the v2.1.

These solutions are not exhaustive.
