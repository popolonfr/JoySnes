Buttons mapping in game:

 Directional pad = Player movements
 Start or X = Open the option screen
 A = Attack
 B = Jump

Buttons mapping in option screen:
Start or X = Close the option screen
 Y = Cancel

How to execute the Rom:

- If you have a MegaFlashRom with konami mapper without SCC, use the
  loader FLK4.COM (by GDX).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC, use the loader FL.COM (by GDX) or
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- If your MSX has a Memory Mapper of 512KB or more try with
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax). Be careful, the game does not work with the v2.1.

These solutions are not exhaustive.
