These patches (v1.3) allow to play to Metal Gear on MSX with the
8 buttons of a SNES controller using JoySNES adapter.


"Metal Gear (J) [JoySNES].IPS" file is the patch for Japanese
version of Metal Gear.

"Metal Gear [JoySNES].IPS" file is the patch for European
version of Metal Gear.
 
"Metal Gear Remix [JoySNES].IPS" file is the patch for Remix
version (v1.9) of Metal Gear.

Metal Gear Remix is the version translated into English by
Takamichi Suzukawa, Jon Taylor and Nekura_Hoka.

When the patch is applied to the Rom, the game will be
 playable with only the JoySNES (in extended mode).

Buttons mapping:

 Directional pad = Player movements
 L trigger = Open/Close weapons menu
 R trigger = Open/Close equipment menu
 X = Continue 
 Y = Transceiver
 A = Shoot/Select
 B = Punch/Abort/Skip texts
 Start = Pause 

During Pause, press X or Y to open the menu of game save or load.
The file name is always written with the keyboard.
Press the ESC key to return to the game.

How to execute the Rom:

- If you have a MegaFlashRom with konami mapper without SCC, use the
  loader FLK4.COM (by GDX).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC, use the loader FL.COM (by GDX) or
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- If your MSX has a Memory Mapper of 512KB or more try with
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax). Be careful, the game does not work with the v2.1.

These solutions are not exhaustive.
