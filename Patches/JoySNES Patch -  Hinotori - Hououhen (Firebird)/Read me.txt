"Hinotori - Hououhen (J) [JoySNES].IPS" file is a patch for the Rom of the

Japanese versions or translated versions by Bifi and Django.

http://www.msx.org/wiki/How_to_use_IPS_files

When the patch is applied to the Rom, the game will be
 playable with only the JoySNES (in extended mode).

Buttons mapping:

 Directional pad = Player movements
 L = Open/Close the weapon purchase menu
 R = Open in-use items menu
 X = Show the passages that interconnect the stages / Continue a game over
 Y = Show the map of the current stage in hand
 A = Shoot/Select
 B = Jump/Close in-use items menu
 Start = Pause (During the pause press Home key to see the password
         corresponding to your progress so far. If you press HOME again
         You will be able to enter a password that you have previously noted.)

How to execute the Rom:

- If you have a MegaFlashRom with konami mapper without SCC, use the
  loader FLK4.COM (by GDX).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC, use the loader FL.COM (by GDX) or
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- If your MSX has a Memory Mapper of 512KB or more try with
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax). Be careful, the game does not work with the v2.1.

These solutions are not exhaustive.
