Buttons mapping in game:

 Directional pad = Player movements
 A = Fire
 B = Select a weapon
 Start = Pause / Continue the game after a game over
 X = Autofire (JoySNES only)
 Y = Same as B with Autofire, Usable but prefer B (JoySNES only)


How to execute the Rom:

- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC, use the loader FL.COM (by GDX) or
  OPFX.COM (by Manuel Pazos and Ramones).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC + SD, use OPFXSD.COM (by Manuel
  Pazos and Ramones).
- If you have a MegaSram SCC, use MGLOAD.COM (by Tsujikawa) or
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- If your MSX has a Memory Mapper of 512KB and a SCC cartridge (without
  game ROM) or more try with SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- To launch an improved version, launch the ROM from MegaFlashROM SCC or a
  MegaSram SCC inserted in a Slot. You need a second SCC cartridge in Slot 2
  to get the voices. An internal Memory Mapper is required for this version.
  You can use FL.COM, MGLOAD.COM, SROM.COM, etc depending on your configuration.
