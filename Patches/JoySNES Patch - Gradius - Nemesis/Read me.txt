Use one of the following software to apply a patch.

When the patch is applied to the Rom, the game will be
playable with only a SNES controller and a JoySNES or a controller for FM-Towns.


Buttons mapping in game:

 Directional pad = Player movements
 A = Fire
 B = Select a weapon
 Start = Pause / Continue the game after a game over
 X = Autofire (JoySNES only)
 Y = Same as B with Autofire, Usable but prefer B (JoySNES only)


How to execute the Rom:

- If you have a MegaFlashRom with konami mapper without SCC, use the
  loader FLK4.COM (by GDX).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC, use the loader FL.COM (by GDX) or
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- If your MSX has a Memory Mapper of 512KB or more try with
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- To launch an SCC version, launch the ROM from MegaFlashROM SCC or a MegaSram
  SCC inserted in a Slot. You need a second SCC cartridge in Slot 2 to get the
  voices of Victor's version. An internal Memory Mapper is required for this
  version. You can use FL.COM, MGLOAD.COM, SROM.COM, etc depending on your
  configuration.

These solutions are not exhaustive.
