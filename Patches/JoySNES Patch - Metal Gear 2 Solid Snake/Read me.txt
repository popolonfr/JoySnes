This patch allow to play to "Metal Gear 2 - Solid Snake" on MSX with
the 8 buttons of a SNES controller using JoySNES adapter.


"Metal Gear 2 [JoySNES].IPS" file is the patch for Japanese
version of Metal Gear and translated versions.

Use one of the following software to apply the patch.
http://www.msx.org/wiki/How_to_use_IPS_files

When the patch is applied to the Rom, the game will be
 playable with only the JoySNES (in extended mode).

Buttons mapping:

 Direction pad = Player movements
 L trigger = Open/Close weapons menu
 R trigger = Open/Close equipment menu
 X = Crawl (as A + B) 
 Y = Transceiver
 A = Shoot/Select
 B = Punch/Abort/Skip texts
 Start = Pause
 Select = Load/Save a game

The file name of saving game is always written with the keyboard.

How to execute the Rom:

- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC, use the loader FL.COM (by GDX) or
  OPFX.COM (by Manuel Pazos and Ramones).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC + SD, use OPFXSD.COM (by Manuel
  Pazos and Ramones).
- If you have a MegaSram SCC, use MGLOAD.COM (by Tsujikawa) or
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- If your MSX has a Memory Mapper of 1024KB and a SCC cartridge (without
  ROM) or more try with SROM.COM with /T option (by Louthrax).
  Note: The game does not work with the v2.1.


These solutions are not exhaustive.
