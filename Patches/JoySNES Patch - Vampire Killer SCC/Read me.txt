crc32: ba055161.

"VampKill-scc-sub [JoySNES].ips" file is a subsidiary version of this
patch, the buttons A and Y are reversed (see below).

When the patch is applied to the Rom, the game will be
 playable with only the JoySNES (in extended mode).

How to execute the Rom:

- If you have a MegaFlashRom with 8k ASCII mapper, use the loader
  FL8.COM (by GDX).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom with konami mapper without SCC, use the
  loader FLK4.COM (by GDX).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC, use the loader FL.COM (by GDX) or
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- If your MSX has a Memory Mapper of 512KB or more try with
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax). Be careful, the game does not work with the v2.1.

These solutions are not exhaustive.
