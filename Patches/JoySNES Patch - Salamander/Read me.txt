These patches allows to play to Salamander on MSX with 8 buttons
of a controller for SNES using JoySNES adapter.

"Salamander [JoySNES].IPS" file is the patch for the original
ROM (crc32 = c36f559d. It can also be applied on enhanced versions provided
that the ROM file does not exceed 144KB. For those that exceed this size,
please apply the JoySNES patch before applying the other patch.

See also the folder /Extra, I grouped together those I found in it.

Use one of the following software to apply the patch.
http://www.msx.org/wiki/How_to_use_IPS_files

When the patch is applied to the Rom, the game will be
playable with only a JoySNES or a controller for FM-Towns.


Buttons mapping in game:

 Directional pad = Player movements
 A = Fire
 B = Select a weapon
 Start = Pause / Continue the game after a game over
 Select = Bring the other player during a pause (Dual play)
 X = Autofire (JoySNES only)
 Y = Same as B with Autofire, Usable but prefer B (JoySNES only)


How to execute the Rom:

- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC, use the loader FL.COM (by GDX) or
  OPFX.COM (by Manuel Pazos and Ramones).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC + SD, use OPFXSD.COM (by Manuel
  Pazos and Ramones).
- If you have a MegaSram SCC, use MGLOAD.COM (by Tsujikawa) or
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- If your MSX has a Memory Mapper of 512KB and a SCC cartridge (without
  game ROM) or more try with SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- To launch some improved versions, launch the ROM from MegaFlashROM SCC or a
  MegaSram SCC inserted in a Slot. Sometimes You need a second SCC cartridge
  in Slot 2 to get the voices. An internal Memory Mapper is required for this
  version. You can use FL.COM, MGLOAD.COM, SROM.COM, etc depending on your
  configuration.

These solutions are not exhaustive.
