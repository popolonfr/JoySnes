When the patch is applied to the Rom, the game will be

Buttons mapping in game:

 Directional pad = Player movements
 A = Use an item
 B = Jump
 Start = Pause
 Select = Give up
 Y = Displays the course plan during the pause
 X = Play / Mute the music

Using buttons in edit mode:

  Right and Left = Move the cursor (file name / password)
  X = Cancel / Play again the stage
  Y = OK
  L = Switch from the editor to the options menu and vice versa / Load a file

How to execute the Rom:

- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC, use the loader FL.COM (by GDX) or
  OPFX.COM (by Manuel Pazos and Ramones).
- If you have a MegaFlashRom SCC + SD, use OPFXSD.COM (by Manuel
  Pazos and Ramones).
- If you have a MegaSram SCC, use MGLOAD.COM (by Tsujikawa) or
  SROM.COM (by Louthrax).
- If your MSX has a Memory Mapper of 256KB and a SCC cartridge (without
  ROM) or more try with SROM.COM with /T option (by Louthrax).
  Note: The game does not work with the v2.1.
